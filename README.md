# Stroke-Prediction-with-Machine-learning-

- F.P
 (FP) occurs when ML predicts someone has suffered a stroke, even though the person actually did not have a stroke

 - FN
 false negative (FN) occurs when ML predicts a person has not had a stroke, when in fact the person actually has had a stroke

In this case we should press FN, because errors in detecting a stroke can be potentially life-threatening and can have serious long-term consequences for the patient, for this reason we will use recall metrics.**
